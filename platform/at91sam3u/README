Platform support for the ATMEL AT91SAM3U ARM Cortex-M3 microcontrollers.

This is a base platform -- it needs to be specialized for a particular
board (see sam3uek as an example of this) to be useful.  In particular
it does not provide the platform/board.h (which must include the 
correct at91sam3*h file and mux config).
